# [Optional] Debugging Practice: Flatipotle

Flatiron School has decided to dabble in the food industry and just opened up a
brand new fast casual Mexican restaurant (not at all a clone of a certain
popular restaurant). Engineers were hired to design a web app to allow users to
submit orders online, but they mysteriously disappeared and left everything
broken. It's now your job to try to find all the bugs and fix the app!

## Setup

- Clone this repository and `cd` into it
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the app locally

## Deliverables

1. A user should be able to see an order form with options for protein,
   fillings, toppings, and sides.

2. A user should be able to select as many proteins, fillings, toppings, and
   sides as they desire.

3. A user should be able to submit the form with their selections and see their
   order(s) listed under "All Orders."

4. If a user selects any sides, they should be able to click on a button to view
   their side choices.

## Helpful Things to Keep In Mind

- **Read** the errors you receive in your browser and console
- `console.log`, `debugger`, and **React Dev Tools** are your friends
- Did we _return_ the values we want?
- Did we import and export our components correctly?
- Did we pass down the _props_ that we need?
- Are our functions defined with the correct parameters?
- How do we change state?
- This app uses Semantic for styling - you will not need to worry about any
  errors here.
